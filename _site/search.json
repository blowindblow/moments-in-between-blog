Tableau has also been really useful for quick prototyping, just to get an idea of how the graph in my head actually looks like. When I was a student, I used Stata for my final year project. That’s about it! I’ve been toying with the idea of learning javascript as well but I really should just focus on R and Python for now.\r\nThis blog will mostly be about R. I’m thinking Tidytuesday attempts, random R tips/guides, data science projects, data visualisations, perhaps some generative art and whatever else catches my interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
