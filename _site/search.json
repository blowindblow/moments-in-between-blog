A lot of brain juices goes into a crafting a particular function or generating a complex graph but when I inevitably revisit those code, I can never understand them. Also, all the interesting R packages or snippets I come across while scrolling through my Twitter feed needs a home where I can easily visit.\r\nThe title “Moments in between” is inspired by Nell’s, a Korean rock band, music album. If I were to compare their music to Western bands, it is a mix of Coldplay and Radiohead. Frankly, I’m not super familiar with either of them but it’s a comparison that I’ve seen around often, and agree with.\r\nIt takes a lot of effort to go from raw data to clean data and then from clean data to graphs, plots, etc. I aspire to capture those ‘moments in between’ – where the dirty work takes place – in this blog. I am by no means an expert in R but hopefully this blog brings me a step closer to being one.\r\nSome posts will probably be embarrassingly basic. A tiny hope I have is that instead of consulting google on which to use (geom_col or geom_bar), I can get my answers from this self curated blog of mine. It’s probably a moonshot, if the volume and content of my Google queries is anything to by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
