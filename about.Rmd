  Some additional details about the blog
---

I enjoy data visualisation, and just working with data in general. My tool of choice is `R`, though occasionally I delve into `Python.` `Tableau` has also been really useful for quick prototyping, just to get an idea of how the graph in my head actually looks like. When I was a student, I used `Stata` for my final year project. That's about it! I've been toying with the idea of learning `javascript` as well but I really should just focus on `R` and `Python` for now.

This blog will mostly be about R. I'm thinking Tidytuesday attempts, random R tips/guides, data science projects, data visualisations, perhaps some generative art and whatever else catches my interest.
